  longer `null`.
- Tree on macOS: Fixed <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> keys to collapse or
  expand nodes.
- ComboBox on macOS: Fixed keyboard navigation and show/hide popup.
- Button and ToggleButton: Support per component minimum height (set client

  the system default renderer (e.g. done in NetBeans).
- Label and ToolTip: Fixed font sizes for HTML headings.
